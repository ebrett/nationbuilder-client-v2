# Raw Idea: NationBuilder API Ruby Gem - Phase 1 (v0.1.0)

## Feature Description

Phase 1 focuses on core infrastructure for the NationBuilder API Ruby gem, including:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow implementation
- Base client architecture with HTTP.rb
- Error handling and custom exceptions
- Configuration management
- Request/response logging

This is the foundation phase that will enable all subsequent API resource implementations.
